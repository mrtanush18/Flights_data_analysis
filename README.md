# Flight Occupancy & Revenue Optimization Analysis
This project provides a comprehensive data-driven analysis aimed at improving airline profitability by optimizing seat occupancy rates and pricing strategies. It investigates trends in ticket bookings, fare conditions, and aircraft performance to offer actionable insights in a highly competitive and regulated industry.

## Problem Statement
The airline is currently facing multiple challenges:

* Stricter environmental regulations and rising flight taxes

* Increased fuel and labor costs

* Decreased profitability due to underutilized capacity

To combat these issues, this analysis focuses on:

* Increasing seat occupancy rates

* Optimizing fare strategies across aircraft and classes

* Enhancing overall customer experience

## Recommendations
* Dynamic Pricing by Aircraft Type
Adjust fares based on aircraft conditions and amenities to strike a balance between demand and profitability.

* Reassess Underperforming Aircraft
Investigate low-revenue aircraft like CN1 for possible upgrades, better routes, or retirement.

* Maximize Peak Season Potential
Focus marketing and promotions around high-booking periods (e.g., July).

* Occupancy-Driven Revenue Modeling
Utilize simulation models to predict revenue growth at higher occupancy thresholds and guide pricing strategy accordingly.

## Tools & Technologies
* Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
